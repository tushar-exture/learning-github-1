Testing GIT versioning


version 0.1 : GIT is initiated

version 0.2 : This file is updated and should be staged and commited for use

version 0.3 : Oops! I forgot a small change, so now I should have v0.2 in staged and v0.3 in working area. SUCCESS!!! visually confirmed through MASTER branch history.

version 0.4 : .ignorefile will ignore all the files from commiting to git repo. This is an essential function of github.

version 0.5 : How to see git diff works, this command is added to test the verbose nature of git diff.
