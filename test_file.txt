Testing GIT versioning


version 0.1 : GIT is initiated

version 0.2 : This file is updated and should be staged and commited for use

version 0.3 : Oops! I forgot a small change, so now I should have v0.2 in staged and v0.3 in working area. SUCCESS!!! visually confirmed through MASTER branch history.
